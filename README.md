# Shaka-API-2
 Redesigned API for Shaka (shared Spotify queue) using C++
 
 Was unhappy with the implementation and design of the Java version of this API, I've learned a lot in the past year and decided to redesign it in C++

# TODO
* Handle currSong in the Queue class
* Upload design workflows
* Create Doxygen docs
* Implement Player class
